2.  Lossy compression eliminate "unnecessary" bits of information. Lossless compression lets you recreate the original file exactly. 
3.  when a file is deleted, the information in the address table is erased, but the file itself remains on the hard drive.
4.  I could use free sanitazation tools, which are available online.

5.  Apart from eliminating the reference in the FAT, the actual data on the disk could be overwritten with zeros or random data

6.  <stdint.h> is a header file declaring various integer types with certain guaranteed widths

7.  Using these types allows to write implementation- and plattform-independent code

8.  A BYTE is defined as having 8 bit, DWORD and LONG having 32bit and WORD is defined with 16 bit

9.  Thos bits should read 0x42 0x4d

10. bfSize holds the file size of the bitmap file, while biSize is defined as the size of the Bitmapinfoheader structure

11. It suggests that the vertical orientation of the image is upside-down

12. biBitCount

13. This can happen if the user running the copy programm has no write permission for the directory she wants to copy the file to

14. We want to copy one individual structure per read

15. 3

16. fseek is used to move a position pointer through a file stream

17. Indicates the current position of the position pointer
