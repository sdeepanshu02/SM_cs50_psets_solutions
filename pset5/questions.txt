0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis islongest word in English language 

1.  returns resource usage measures

2.  16 members

3.  before and after are passed by reference to calculate to save time and memory resources as the 2 structs would not have to be copied

4.  In the for loop of main, the program reads characters in one by one. 
    The program checks that the characters are either alphabetical or a apostrophe. 
    If it passes the check, the character is saved in a word buffer. 
    This continues until a non-alphabetical character (such as \n) is read.
    Afterwhich, the word is null-terminated and spell-checked.
    If during this process a digit or an excessively long word is read, the entire line is scrapped.

5.  fscanf is vulnerable to buffer overflow. 
    Additionally, we are already checking if each character is alphabetical and thus fgetc is likely to be more efficient too.

6.  The parameters for check and load are only meant to be read from. 
    Declaring them as const makes the program throw errors and alert us if they are wrongly written to

7.  Used hashtable as the datastructure and linked lists for storing data
    Linked list compose of a character array to store word and a pointer to store the address of the next node 

8.  It took some 2-3 secs

9.  I was storing the new word at the end of linked list which took some time to iterate over to last node
    So I re-wrote the code to store in the starting of the hashtable and the new word pointed towards the old 0th index word.

10. Hashtable used is quite large in size. It takes some extra time to iterarte over null valued index of hashtable
